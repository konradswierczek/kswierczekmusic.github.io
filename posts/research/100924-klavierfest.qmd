Bowdoin College hosted a fascinating symposium to discuss the intersection of artificial intelligence, cutting-edge technology, and the timeless art of music. I was invited to give a talk on my research at the MAPLE Lab, and participate in a panel discussion. My talk was titled "Does AI Hear What We Hear? Testing Music Technology’s Human Touch". You can find the slides from my talk, with reproducible cobe [on my GitHub.](https://konradswierczek.github.io/klavierfest2024)
