# Konrad Swierczek
### Audio Engineer | Musician | Researcher

I'm passionate about music, technology, and science. I'm focused on using my extensive technical skills and musical judgment to support performers and clients while bringing meaningful experiences to audiences. My experience has made me adaptable to the dynamic landscape and prepared to solve problems in high-pressure enviornments. I am also dedicated to bringing a collaborative approach to everything I do. Feel free to reach out to me over email if you're interested in chatting or working together!

## About Me

I started working professionally as an audio engineer in 2011 for Audio Operations in Mississauga. I completed a Bachelor of Music (specialization, Music Cognition) at McMaster University in 2018 where I studied jazz double bass with Clark Johnston, and also played in the McMaster Big Band under Mike Malone, and studied small ensembles with Kevin Dempsey. I also completed an undergraduate thesis focusing on the perception of diminished seventh chords. In 2019, I started graduate studies at McMaster University in the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience, & Behaviour working with Matthew Woolhouse at the Digital Music Lab. Unfortunatley, [in 2023, Matthew passed away from cancer](https://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/news/matthew-woolhouse-1965-2023). I was "adopted" by Michael Schutz just across the hall at the Music Acoustics Perception & Learning Lab, where I continued my PhD work. I'm also the Digital Media Manager of the Canadian Chopin Society, where I've also work as the Technical Director for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Canadian Chopin Piano Competitions.
