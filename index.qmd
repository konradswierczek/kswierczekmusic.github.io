Welcome to my website: I'm passionate about music, technology, and science. Here you can find some details about what I'm up to, and some of my past work. I'm not very active on social media, so I hope to use this website to document the exciting work I'm fortunate to be doing! My professional life so far has led to range very different work: although I'd like to think it's all linked by a love music and a desire to both understand music while improving our ability to create it and spread it with technology. With that in mind, this site is split into three sections to keep things somewhat tidy. Feel free to reach out to me over email if you're interested in chatting or working together!

## About Me

I completed a Bachelor of Music (specialization, Music Cognition) at McMaster University in 2018 where I studied jazz double bass with Clark Johnston, and also played in the McMaster Big Band under Mike Malone, and studied small ensembles with Kevin Dempsey. In 2019, I started graduate studies at McMaster University in the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience, & Behaviour working with Matthew Woolhouse at the Digital Music Lab. Unfortunatley, [in 2023, Matthew passed away from cancer](https://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/news/matthew-woolhouse-1965-2023). I was "adopted" by Michael Schutz just across the hall at the Music Acoustics Perception & Learning Lab, where I continued my PhD work. 

I'm also the Digital Media Manager of the Canadian Chopin Society, where I've also work as the Technical Director for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Canadian Chopin Piano Competitions.
